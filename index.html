        <p>Hello! My name is Ruby Higdon, and I'm a student at BYU-Idaho studying data science. 
            I'm working as a Student Office Assistant in the Executive Office on campus, which has 
            given me amazing hands-on experience and allowed me to form connections that will be 
            beneficial as I pursue my career. I've been married for just under a year and love 
            spending time outdoors with my husband and dog. Second only to my love for my husband 
            is my love of Diet Coke and shopping! More importantly, I love my Savior, and I'm grateful 
            for the opportunity to grow my faith as I grow my knowledge at this university! </p>
