        <p>Hello! My name is Ruby Higdon, and I'm a student at BYU-Idaho studying data science. 
            I'm working as a Student Office Assistant in the Executive Office on campus, which has 
            given me amazing hands-on experience and allowed me to form connections that will be 
            beneficial as I pursue my career. I've been married for just under a year and love 
            spending time outdoors with my husband and dog. Second only to my love for my husband 
            is my love of Diet Coke and shopping! More importantly, I love my Savior, and I'm grateful 
            for the opportunity to grow my faith as I grow my knowledge at this university!</p>

        <p>Far more than a place that grows potatoes, Idaho is covered in gorgeous lakes, rivers, and 
            mountains. It even contains part of the world-famous Yellowstone National Park. 
            From hiking and swimming to shopping and playing, there is so much to explore and discover. 
            It's no surprise that Idaho is ranked by cencus.gov as the #4 fastest growing state. 
            People are starting to catch on!</p>
